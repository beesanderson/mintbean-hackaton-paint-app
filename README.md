# Code Pen Boiler Plate Paint App

This is a proxy repository for the [Mintbean Hiring Hackathon Event](https://mintbean.io/meets/cfa4fa54-c706-4c51-a04f-671f6686f9fd) starting 11/16/2021. My original intent was to join in a team (rules allow for a maximum of 2 Developers and 1 Designer per group) but upon further investigation I have decided to forgo my group and tackle this project solo. 

My teams original plan was to do this project in React with the `<canvas>` approach and paint by way of DOM manipulation. Being that I have no experience in React I am left to choose if this would be the best option for me to do since my main priority is to get a project for my portfolio out of this event. I am left to reflect and consult and fear that allotted time is a major factor in whether or not I will even partake in this Hackathon. 

I will be following the thorough (and quite honestly pretty versatile!!) Hackathon project [guidelines from Mintbean](https://info.mintbean.io/hiring-hackathon-guide) pretty heavily for direction and advice. If anyone bothers to read this and is in a similar boat (I hope not! ha!) as I am please give it a quick glance as I'm sure you'll find some pretty useful information for general project deployment FAQs and best practices. 


### My Team 
#### (before I went solo due to inexperience...)
My original team member was [Rohit Jacob](https://github.com/rohitgj169) who is still offering to help me and have me join his team despite my complete inexperience. He's a wonderful guy!! His portfolio is listed [here](http://rohitjacob.tech/) and he is currently looking for work after graduating his bootcamp. Please, please give him a little "look see" because you won't regret it. I mean, as the fact that he's endured my super happy, bubbly, talkative, *plus* rainbow loving self speaks **volumes** about him!!! He's patiently endured my questions (but mostly conversations about silly things such as my top knot bun looking ridiculous to name one.) Despite that all, he has continued to make himself available to me to help with any questions or issues I run into (though luckily due to the AMAZING community from the previous [Girl Develop It Hackathon](https://girldevelopit.com/events/#/list) I just finished up on 11/12/21 and this new loving and supportive community at [Mintbean's Hackathon Discord Channel](https://discord.com/invite/j7CjBAz) I honestly haven't had to ask to many questions as everyone has already answered them before I had the chance!!!)

To be honest, on the [Mintbean Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/j7CjBAz) they've been so supportive and encouraging they've motivated someone like me to participate in the event that I realized is for *Junior* Developers either the day before or the day of after registering...*even* if its just for the experience and I won't submit my project to be sent on through their hiring channels!!!! 

- Event Start Date - 11/16/2021

- Event End Date - 11/23/2021

I used this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/HarryGateaux/pen/BApxl) as the original root of this project to see how it worked. It is currently saved in its own folder `/codepen` but I doubt I will keep it for the entirety of the project. 



## The Hackathon Instructions: 
These are the [instructions](https://mintbean.io/meets/cfa4fa54-c706-4c51-a04f-671f6686f9fd/resources) for the Mintbean Hackathon Hiring Event. The following are links for inspiration and visuals of what the project fundamental code structure options are.

- Reality of situation: I am completely unqualified to partake in this challenge...so let's do it :)

# Project to be done Solo
I spoke with my team member Rohit and am considering that the best option for me might be to just do this project on my own solo though I don't know if that would be the best option...Will be looking into react a bit more and go through their tutorial which has you make a basic tic tac toe app. 

- Yes I believe that I will be doing this project alone. In reading and consulting advice from the [Mintbean Hackathon Guide](https://info.mintbean.io/hiring-hackathon-guide) which states in the "*Helpful Tips*" section to Keep it simple by avoiding building something that involves skills that you don't have and to **always** over estimate any feature implementation as it will generally take even more then that to enforce. 

# Mintbean Hackathon Guide
In further reading from the [Mintbean Hackathon Guide](https://info.mintbean.io/hiring-hackathon-guide) I am realizing the extent that these projects will go through in order to assist us in being hired. They will be submitted to recruiters **plus** employers and hiring managers and I am left to reflect on the fact that I still don't have an actual portfolio site nor do I have my resume updated and haven't even done anything with my LinkedIn account either. I am wondering if this whole event is premature and whether or not I am qualified to partake in it but will continue to pursue. My previous team from the Girl Develop It Hackathon I just finished up this last Friday (the event from from 11/10 to 11/12) advised me to consider to still join forces with my team member Rohit even though I have no experience with React...I might have ruined this option already.

I think I will be capable to figure this out on my own considering what all I've done, been through, and completed to the current date. No choice but to press on regardless. 



# Plan of Action: 

- Get a VERY clear idea of what I will be building (was recommended by Rohit to pursue the pixel version instead of the canvas option on React but once again have no experience with React)

- Have strict project features/plans for application in place. Consider using [Trello](https://trello.com/bridgette304/boards) as a way to get an idea of project objectives and deadlines. This will be my first time using Trello personally. 

- **MVP** Approach: **M**inimal **V**iable **P**roduct --- Get out the absolute bare bone basics of the project before developing any type of styling or UI/UX. This is why Developers are NOT expected to have any design sense because when working on strict project deadlines you will be forced to prioritize functionality over appearance--leave that to the designers (which of course my "team of one" does not have lol) 

- Deploy early and deploy often. Continue to deploy any working code as often as you have it. This is a way to avoid any bugs that will be to close to project deadline to fix which would cause you to possibly need to reload project from a much older code base. 


# To Do: 

### "Boiler Plate" Paint Code
- Absolute MVP basics
    - Does it run? 
    - Does it check all project guidelines?
    - Check off as completed once done.

### Project Landing Page 
- Design is important here! Might want to allocate some extra time to make sure you have a wow factor for this *especially* in the case of project just being boiler plate code. 
    - Does it describe my application?
    - Does it explain the project's features?
    - Does it include a short video?   
        - My love of screen snips may shine here for once lol 
    - Does it have an obvious and clear button link to my **live** application?
    - Does it have a "*Meet the Engineers*" (aka meeeeeeee lol) section that shows a photo of myself and link to my [GitHub](https://github.com/beesanderson?tab=repositories), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bridgette-s-261410223/), and, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beesanderson999)?
        - Consult [Mintbean Hackathon Guide](https://info.mintbean.io/hiring-hackathon-guide) in the "*Great examples of landing pages from our past hackathons:*" section. 
    - Check off as completed once done.

# Day by day notes...

### Day 2 - 11/17/2021

I am starting the tutorial Samantha sent me from [JavaScript30.com](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/61946b0b41ee9b1bad8e11ce/view/194129962), which is tutorial 8 focused on canvas fundamentals. I am starting this tutorial without doing any of the others in hopes that I won't have to but will certainly revisit this site and the other resources that my new friends have shared with me :) 

1. Created new folder titled `Javascript30` that links original tutorial plus GitHub sources. 
2. Attend "Office Hours" meeting hosted by [Monarch](https://twitter.com/monarchwadia) and [Navi](https://twitter.com/Navi1Mann) ([Mintbean](https://twitter.com/mintbeanio) **awesome** founders!) to gleam more insight in how to progress. I must admit my nerves were better set to ease once Monarch spoke about a previous participant who was at a pretty similar experience level as I am who participated in 5 or so hackathons and then went on to win his 6th then got a job that following month. (Just a quick shout out on how thankful I am to have found this community!!!)

    - I did speak up during this meeting to ask about which deployment sites would be the easiest for beginners as I've only hosted twice, once with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with my first full backend project which I did from the MDN tutorial, [Local Library Express MDN Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) and then just recently (aka perhaps a week or two ago?) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for my [Portfolio Website](https://bridgettesanderson.com/)

    - (Which I, of course, am to nervous to actually fully go live with because I keep making my portfolio website only to trash it and start over from the beginning.)
