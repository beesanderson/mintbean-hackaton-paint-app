# Code Pen Boiler Plate Paint App

This is just a quick repository for myself and my partner, Rohit Jacob, and I to play around with and experiment with while we work on our actual project for the Mintbean Hackathon. 

So far we will be using the `<canvas>` approach and paint by way of DOM manipulation. 

Start Date - 11/16/2021

# Am possibly considering doing this project solo as I haven't worked with React at all personally
I spoke with my team member Rohit and am considering that the best option for me might be to just do this project on my own solo though I don't know if that would be the best option...Will be looking into react a bit more and go through their tutorial which has you make a basic tic tac toe app.
