# Code Pen Boiler Plate Paint App

This is a proxy repository for the [Mintbean Hiring Hackathon Event](https://mintbean.io/meets/cfa4fa54-c706-4c51-a04f-671f6686f9fd) starting 11/16/2021. My original intent was to join in a team (rules allow for a maximum of 2 Developers and 1 Designer per group) but upon further investigation I have decided to forgo my group and tackle this project solo. 

My teams original plan was to do this project in React with the `<canvas>` approach and paint by way of DOM manipulation. Being that I have no experience in React I am left to choose if this would be the best option for me to do since my main priority is to get a project for my portfolio out of this event. I am left to reflect and consult and fear that allotted time is a major factor in whether or not I will even partake in this Hackathon. 

- Event Start Date - 11/16/2021

- Event End Date - 11/23/2021

I used this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/HarryGateaux/pen/BApxl) as the original root of this project to see how it worked. It is currently saved in its own folder `/codepen` but I doubt I will keep it for the entirety of the project. 



## The Hackathon Instructions: 
These are the [instructions](https://mintbean.io/meets/cfa4fa54-c706-4c51-a04f-671f6686f9fd/resources) for the Mintbean Hackathon Hiring Event. The following are links for inspiration and visuals of what the project fundamental code structure options are.

- Reality of situation: I am completely unqualified to partake in this challenge...so let's do it :)

# Project to be done Solo
I spoke with my team member Rohit and am considering that the best option for me might be to just do this project on my own solo though I don't know if that would be the best option...Will be looking into react a bit more and go through their tutorial which has you make a basic tic tac toe app. 

- Yes I believe that I will be doing this project alone. In reading and consulting advice from the [Mintbean Hackathon Guide](https://info.mintbean.io/hiring-hackathon-guide) which states in the "*Helpful Tips*" section to Keep it simple by avoiding building something that involves skills that you don't have and to **always** over estimate any feature implementation as it will generally take even more then that to enforce. 

# Mintbean Hackathon Guide
In further reading from the [Mintbean Hackathon Guide](https://info.mintbean.io/hiring-hackathon-guide) I am realizing the extent that these projects will go through in order to assist us in being hired. They will be submitted to recruiters **plus** employers and hiring managers and I am left to reflect on the fact that I still don't have an actual portfolio site nor do I have my resume updated and haven't even done anything with my LinkedIn account either. I am wondering if this whole event is premature and whether or not I am qualified to partake in it but will continue to pursue. My previous team from the Girl Develop It Hackathon I just finished up this last Friday (the event from from 11/10 to 11/12) advised me to consider to still join forces with my team member Rohit even though I have no experience with React...I might have ruined this option already.

I think I will be capable to figure this out on my own considering what all I've done, been through, and completed to the current date. No choice but to press on regardless. 



# Plan of Action: 

- Get a VERY clear idea of what I will be building (was recommended by Rohit to pursue the pixel version instead of the canvas option on React but once again have no experience with React)

- Have strict project features/plans for application in place. Consider using [Trello](https://trello.com/bridgette304/boards) as a way to get an idea of project objectives and deadlines. This will be my first time using Trello personally. 

- **MVP** Approach: **M**inimal **V**iable **P**roduct --- Get out the absolute bare bone basics of the project before developing any type of styling or UI/UX. This is why Developers are NOT expected to have any design sense because when working on strict project deadlines you will be forced to prioritize functionality over appearance--leave that to the designers (which of course my "team of one" does not have lol) 

- Deploy early and deploy often. Continue to deploy any working code as often as you have it. This is a way to avoid any bugs that will be to close to project deadline to fix which would cause you to possibly need to reload project from a much older code base. 


# To Do: 

### "Boiler Plate" Paint Code
- Absolute MVP basics
    - Does it run? 
    - Does it check all project guidelines?
    - Check off as completed once done.

### Project Landing Page 
- Design is important here! Might want to allocate some extra time to make sure you have a wow factor for this *especially* in the case of project just being boiler plate code. 
    - Does it describe my application?
    - Does it explain the project's features?
    - Does it include a short video?   
        - My love of screen snips may shine here for once lol 
    - Does it have an obvious and clear button link to my **live** application?
    - Does it have a "*Meet the Engineers*" (aka meeeeeeee lol) section that shows a photo of myself and link to my [GitHub](https://github.com/beesanderson?tab=repositories), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bridgette-s-261410223/), and, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beesanderson999)?
        - Consult [Mintbean Hackathon Guide](https://info.mintbean.io/hiring-hackathon-guide) in the "*Great examples of landing pages from our past hackathons:*" section. 
    - Check off as completed once done.

# Day by day notes...

### Day 2 - 11/17/2021

I am starting the tutorial Samantha sent me from [JavaScript30.com](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/61946b0b41ee9b1bad8e11ce/view/194129962), which is tutorial 8 focused on canvas fundamentals. I am starting this tutorial without doing any of the others in hopes that I won't have to but will certainly revisit this site and the other resources that my new friends have shared with me :) 

1. Created new folder titled `Javascript30` that links original tutorial plus GitHub sources.
