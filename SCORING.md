## Grading Guidelines  

>### *Front-End & Full-Stack* **ONLY** User Experience & Interface

>- As a user, I can drag my mouse across the screen to make free-form lines.
>- As a user, I can click areas of the screen with my mouse to fill them with a color, texture or pattern.

>- Basic (1 Point) - The API interface is clear and follows standard conventions, and is usable in basic cases without excessive effort.
