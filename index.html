        <p class="indent">
            I entered a Hackathon event for Junior Developers (Mid-Tier Experience Level) as an Entry Level Developer. I have chosen to continue despite lack of experience and even left my original team for it to attempt to do this project on my own. So far I have created a couple working projects through help of tutorials. <span class="github">You can access the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/beesanderson/mintbean-hackaton-paint-app">here</a> to see the current progress of the project.</span>
            <span class="readme">Please refer to the README.md of the project for a bit of insight into the

            <p class="indent">
                I made a project using a tutorial passed along to me by a new friend, <a href="https://github.com/samanthatarrice" target="_blank">Samantha Tarrice</a>, (whom was on my team during my last <a href="https://girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>) to help me start to understand how to tackle this app. The tutorial can be found <a class="italic-text" href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's not much but boy oh boy did this tutorial (which is from <a href="javascript30/index.html" target="_blank">JavaScript30.com</a> by the way!) teach me LOADS! I started to understand the fundamentals of how to do this! It honestly helped me gain enough confidence to start experimenting on my own!

                To see this practice "proxy" project...
            </h3>

            <p class="indent">
                Click <a class="" href="javascript30/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see the simple paint app in action. Now, keep in mind this is just a practice page to see if I could even do this...and I <span class="italic-text">did!!</span> When you're redirected to the site it will just look like a blank page. Fear not! Click and drag your mouse across the screen and you'll see a rainbow brush stroke begin! You'll be able to see that the thickness of brush increments and decrements as you progress. If you right click on the webpage and navigate to the "Inspect" option (in Chrome) you'll bring up the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYyQv0CSZOE" target="_blank">Chrome Dev Tools</a> and you can check out the code for yourself!

            <p class="indent">
                You can also checkout my "in progress" <a href="https://github.com/beesanderson/mintbean-hackaton-paint-app/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> file to read about my progress, notes, musings, and thoughts on the project itself. To see info regarding the "actual" project EOD stopping point for EOD (end of day) 11/17/21 please read the <a href="https://github.com/beesanderson/mintbean-hackaton-paint-app/blob/master/javascript30/README.md" target="_blank">README.md documentation</a> for the canvas fundamental structure.

        <h3>PS- Until I have a better grasp of the logic and am comfortable with using the fundamentals myself (which is pretty straightforward honestly) I'll just be redirecting from the homepage until I actually start working on the UI/UX of the project.</h3>

        <p>Please forgive any oversights, slips, or general silliness as I am pretty brain fried right now and fading fast. Happy coding!!</p>
