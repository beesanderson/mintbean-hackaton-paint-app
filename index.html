        <p class="indent">
            I entered a Hackathon event for Junior Developers (Mid-Tier Experience Level) as an Entry Level Developer. I have chosen to continue despite lack of experience and even left my original team for it to attempt to do this project on my own. So far I have created a couple working projects through help of tutorials. <span class="github">You can access the GitHub <a class="grow-text" href="https://github.com/beesanderson/mintbean-hackaton-paint-app" target="_blank">here</a> to see the current progress of the project.</span>

                I made a project using a tutorial passed along to me by a new friend, <a href="https://github.com/samanthatarrice" target="_blank">Samantha Tarrice</a>, (whom was on my team during my last <a class="highlight" href="https://girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>) to help me start to understand how to tackle this app. The tutorial can be found <a class="italic-text highlight" href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's not much but boy oh boy did this tutorial (which is from <a class="highlight" href="javascript30/index.html" target="_blank">JavaScript30.com</a> by the way!) teach me LOADS! I started to understand the fundamentals of how to do this! It honestly helped me gain enough confidence to start experimenting on my own!

                Click <a class="highlight" href="./javascript30/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see the simple paint app in action. Now, keep in mind this is just a practice page to see if I could even do this...and I <span class="italic-text">did!!</span> When you're redirected to the site it will just look like a blank page. Fear not! Click and drag your mouse across the screen and you'll see a rainbow brush stroke begin! You'll be able to see that the thickness of brush increments and decrements as you progress. If you right click on the webpage and navigate to the "Inspect" option (in Chrome) you'll bring up the <a class="highlight" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYyQv0CSZOE" target="_blank">Chrome Dev Tools</a> and you can check out the code for yourself!

                Didn't have the opportunity to work on this project nor any Hackathon related workflow due to prior existing appointments earlier in the day and getting a couple existing projects hosted through <a class="highlight" href="pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> for my <a class="highlight" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bridgette-sanderson/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile. One project included my previous Hackathon <a class="highlight" href="https://saoigames.itch.io/green-me" target="_blank">GDI Project</a> where I was a Team Lead for my team's project which was an educational web app that we ended up making into a mobile android Target API game first for sake of time constraints. The second is my first solo JavaScript <a class="highlight" href="https://bridgettesanderson.com/snake-by-bridgette/" target="_blank">Snake Game</a>  that wasn't originally intended to be public but will be for the time being.

                Unfortunately today can mostly be seen as a loss in the way of the hackathon project development scope but can attempt to salvage with small intervals of time spent on minimal tasks.

        <p class="indent">
            So far I've been super distracted with getting my <a class="highlight" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bridgette-sanderson/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> all set up. I just set it to display (and maybe notify? I don't know how it actually works tbh) that I am open to work and have been trying to do a bit of social media promotion on Twitter and Facebook. I need to make a "professional" Facebook page and maybe even an Instagram too but that's not important for right now though it will help in the competition. It took me a long time yesterday getting my other projects all set up and deployed correctly due to routing and I still have a handful of things to fix (I think a bit of it has to do with the fact that I'm hosting through GitHub pages through my own personal domain name I bought.)
        </p>

        <h3>Today's Goals: </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Work on getting fundamentals of functionality set up and in my own code.</li>
            <li>Figure out best choice to save paint data.</li>
            <li>Refer to <a class="highlight" href="https://mintbean.io/meets/cfa4fa54-c706-4c51-a04f-671f6686f9fd/resources" target="_blank">project objectives</a> and make sure the MVP meets all minimal requirements for Front-End development project FIRST.</li>
            <p class="mt0"> - Pursue Full-Stack once this, landing page, markdown, and storytelling, personal branding, and social media promotion is met. Only after, MVP is front-end requirements.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            Refer to Day 4 <a class="highlight" href="https://github.com/beesanderson/mintbean-hackaton-paint-app/blob/master/experimentation/README-alt.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> for specific details of day's progression.

        <p class="indent">
            Basically, I was able to complete the project with the assistance of a tutorial and used <a class="highlight" href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.JS</a> which is a JavaScript library for creative coding designed specifically for beginners, designers, artists, educators, and anyone else! I did this by way of the <a class="highlight" href="https://p5js.org/get-started/" target="_blank">p5.js CDN</a> along with the <a class="highlight" href="https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&c=design&m=free" target="_blank">FontAwesome CDN</a>.

            The Tutorial I used: <a class="highlight" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQFibzKT_WE" target="_blank">Simple Paint App</a>
        </h3>

        <p class="indent">
            I'm going through a super quick <a class="highlight" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQFibzKT_WE" target="_blank">tutorial</a> that <a class="highlight" href="https://github.com/Jasmine582" target="_blank">Jasmine Reese</a> passed along to me and it's quite honestly the first time I've ever really used a <a class="highlight" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/" target="_blank">CDN</a> as in the past I've either not been able to get them to work (I know...I'm that helpless!) or just saw them as "cheating" and a way that I could and probably *would* exploit to avoid learning fundamental concepts. Now I'm wishing I would have just started sooner as it would have made my life a bit easier...perhaps at least.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            I was able to complete the following objectives because of this tutorial:

            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
