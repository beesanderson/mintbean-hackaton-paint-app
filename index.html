            Working Branch <a href="javascript30/index.html">Project</a>. Once there please click mouse on browser and begin to draw. You can access the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/beesanderson/mintbean-hackaton-paint-app">here</a> to see the current progress of the project. 
        </h2>

        <p>Please refer to the /root <a href="https://github.com/beesanderson/mintbean-hackaton-paint-app/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> of the project for a bit of insight into the "blog" of this working project.</p>

        <p>To see info regarding the "actual" project EOD stopping point for EOD (end of day) 11/17/21 please read the <a href="https://github.com/beesanderson/mintbean-hackaton-paint-app/blob/master/javascript30/README.md">README.md documentation</a> for the canvas fundamental structure.</p>

        <p>Please forgive any oversights, slips, or general silliness as I am pretty brain fried right now and fading fast. Happy coding!!</p>

        <h3>PS- Until I have a better grasp of the logic and am comfortable with using the fundamentals myself (which is pretty straightforward honestly) I'll just be redirecting from the homepage until I actually start working on the UI/UX of the project.</h3>
