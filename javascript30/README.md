# This is a "Code Along" from [JavaScript30.com](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/61946b0b41ee9b1bad8e11ce/view/194129962) Canvas Tutorial

[GitHub Project Repository](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) 
- This project is from "Day 8" (or the eighth tutorial video) titled "*Fun with HTML5 Canvas*" 

Also, I will be including the semicolons in this project as I know for me personally it was helpful as a "rookie/noob" or beginner developer. It helps indicate where a code block ends and to this day I can still get confused with a lot of nested elements. I do most of my own personal development without them for the most part although have found them incredibly useful when learning something new. 

## Notes || Musings
Hmm, seem to be having issues with the 
```JS
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
```
properties...it is still falling back to the default in `HTML5` markup of 800x800 despite instructor's being resized to browser window's dimensions. Gunna close out and reload and see if that helps. Sometimes `LivePreview` VS Code extension can be a bit goofy.
