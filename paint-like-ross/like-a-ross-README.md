# Starting over again because as we all know it's best practice to do so the night before the extended deadline. 

Smashing. 

## Resources Used

Honestly, it's just been all my other notes. I'm going to be relying super heavily on the [MDN Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) and the [W3Schools Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_reference.asp) tutorials and documentation to do this but honestly I'm somewhat confidient that I can do it. I just wish I had more time...I really could have made something super cool I bet! It's not that this wasn't enough time, I just didn't use it wisely over the weekend and the rest of the week was honestly pretty chaotic for me because of my baby getting sick and various other things that came up...but what else is new.

## Update: 3:35 am Thanksgiving Day (lol)

I didn't sleep at all last night from staying up so late working on this but I had to update and share that I found the most AMAZING resource yet! It's using that stupid [a5JS]() (which is the furthest thing from stupid I actually love it but I want to do everything myself vanilla style so I can understand better but perhaps this is my downfall?) but I've been able to piggy back off of it to learn how to do some other awesome things! Well more accurately I've learned what to look for and this gave me an awesome context/insight into whats happening in my sleep deprived state.

## Bugs I don't have time to fix: 

- The fact that the responsive automatic canvas container reset wipes existing canvas data like on refresh. To bad sorry guys :( I haven't showered in 5 days and have four (probably will only go to two though lol!) Thanksgivings to go to today!! Gah!




- Well I actually got a working eraser but have run out of time to figure it out. I'm having trouble resetting it because I used the `destination-out` method as a function and for whatever reason the ways I've been trying to switch it back to default `source-over` isn't working. Its **7:03am** and I literally didn't sleep at all tonight...lol. Totally worth it though! Its Thanksgiving so it's no worries.
