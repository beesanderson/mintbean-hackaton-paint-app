# Starting over again because as we all know it's best practice to do so the night before the extended deadline.

## Resources Used

Honestly, it's just been all my other notes. I'm going to be relying super heavily on the [MDN Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) and the [W3Schools Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_reference.asp) tutorials and documentation to do this but honestly I'm somewhat confidient that I can do it. I just wish I had more time...I really could have made something super cool I bet! It's not that this wasn't enough time, I just didn't use it wisely over the weekend and the rest of the week was honestly pretty chaotic for me because of my baby getting sick and various other things that came up...but what else is new.
